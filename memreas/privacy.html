<p><b>(3) Cookies and Session Identifiers </b></p>

<p>We use cookies on this website to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience with memreas. A cookie is a text file sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser – session cookies. The text file is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser. </p>

<p>We may send a cookie which may be stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive – persistent cookies. We may use the information we obtain from the cookie in the administration of this website, to improve the website’s usability and for marketing purposes. We may also use that information to recognise your computer when you visit our website, and to personalise our website for you. </p>

<p>Our advertisers may also send you cookies, which are session cookies. These cookies do not operate once you logoff completely from memreas.</p>

<p>We also use session identifiers in memreas mobile applications to provide a function similar to cookies mentioned above. These session identifiers do not operate once you logoff completely from memreas.</p>

<p>In case of Android and iOS mobile Apps, we use session identifiers which are functionally similar to Cookies and provide you with a more personal and interactive experience with memreas. Unlike the persistent cookies, these session identifiers do not function once you logoff completely from memreas. memreas may also gather information such as IP address, device identifier, internal session ID, user's domain, type of Internet browser, domain of Web site. An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. Such information will not identify you personally: it is statistical data about our visitors and their use of our site. This statistical data does not identify any personal details whatsoever. It is used only to provide statistical information regarding the use of our website, to our advertisers. </p>

<p>All computers have the ability to decline cookies. This can be done by activating the setting on your browser which enables you to decline the cookies. In order to use our services offered through memreas, your web browser must accept Cookies. Please note that should you choose to decline cookies, you may be unable to access particular features of our website, and you may not be able to receive our services.</p>
